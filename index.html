						<h3>Christina Katrakis</h3>
						<p><b>Renown international artist, curator, coordinator, producer, gallerist, art historian, critic and professor.</b></p>
						<p>As an artist, Christina works with a number of renown world galleries, from Anna Tzarev in New York to EichBlatt in Berlin. Her work is on display in museums from Institute of Modern Art in Chicago to Paris Museum of Modern Art, from major Exhibition Centers of Cape Town, South Africa to Xinyan, China. After going through a dramatic psychological trauma due to the death of her child, Christina painted to cope with the loss. She painted her pain onto the canvas day and night. Creating new series of works “The Zone”.</p>
						<div class="more-text">
							<p>For these series of paintings, she was awarded “commended main prize” at the “Freedom to Create World Prize”, after which she went on the mission of good will. Healing others through art and art therapy, and helping those in need. Yet her artist’s career goes hand in hand with her curatorial one. For instance, Christina is one of the unique cases, for she was both represented as an artist by Christies’ and also worked for Christies’ Auction as their curator. Hence she knows both sides of the art marketing tale first hand. Christina also works with Hollywood directors and producers on films, as an artist, creative idea, story maker, advisor and producer, such renown Hollywood directors as Mary Lambert, is one of them. She’s the legendary director of Steven Kings cult films Pet Semetary I & II, Siesta with Jody Foster and Isabella Rossellini, epic videos with Madonna such as Like a Virgin, La Isla Bonita, Like a Prayer, Material Girl, videos with Sting, Chris Isaak, Annie Lenox, Jennet Jackson and more. </p>
							<p>As a curator, she worked for numerous international Art Fairs, from Art Moscow to Art Belin, from Art Paris to Art Huston. In her recent cultural coordinator positions, such as in Orion Projects (USA) - she managed $600 million investment project and in Lefkadia (Russia) - she managed $450 million investment project, from start to finish. As a curator of the Voronov’s Museum of Modern Art, Christina managed $50 million worth collection of art, coordinated and handled hundreds of millions worth in artifacts: Picasso, Warhol, Soutine, Kandinsky, Giacometti, Degas, Modigliani etc. </p>
							<p>As an international coordinator, Christina Katrakis was officially appointed as the UNESCO project’s coordinator by the Centro per I’UNESCO di Bologna, curating and coordinating a number of major international cultural events and projects. </p>
							<p>As a gallerist, she opened and ran her own Katrakis Gallery and also other commercial galleries such as Mironova Gallery of Art and worked with a number of renown contemporary artists, representing and selling their work, such painters as Kazimir Malevich, Robert Indiana and Damien Hirst or photographers like Roger Ballen, Oliviero Toscani and John Kennedy. As an art critic and art historian, Christina collaborated with a number of historical figures, such as cult writer-poet Robert Graves’ family and most recently Ultraviolet and wrote many articles on their recollections, Ultraviolet’s work with Picasso, Dali and Warhol among others. As an international curator, she also works with major fashion-design art-platforms, such as Berlin Alternative Fashion Week. And as an artist she produces interior design elements, fabric design, furniture and architectural forms, working with international designers and architects. As a private art collections curator, Christina has worked with major international private art collectors such as Michail Nikolaev, Lord Bookatz, Dakis Joannou and Capeloutzos family. She herself is an art collector too, with the collection which she develops and expands in various directions: pre-Colombian art, ancient Greek and Hellenistic art, Neolithic and prehistoric art, paleontological collection, indigenous art, naïve art, iconography, Itinerants and modern art collection with works by Picasso and the likes. Hence, Christina is an artist whose work is in collections, she’s a curator who builds the art collections and she’s also a collector herself, knowing all three aspects much too well. And finally, Christina worked as a professor of fine arts and art history, first lecturing in the university and then leaving the institution. Because she felt that the institution treated students as paying customers, rather than, the individuals with an acute need to obtain vital skills and knowledge - of how to succeed in their chosen field. –“They were as helpless chicks, who were about to be kicked out of the nest, graduated, with lots of theory yet without any knowledge of how to fly, how to succeed and build their career.” – she recalls in her interview and continues: –“ I knew that too well, since I myself, devoted more than 10 years of my life to obtaining specialized higher education in my field, from numerous great educational institutions: Lorenzo di Medici, Kiev Art Academy, Sorbonne, Kiev School of Arts, Memphis University, Maryland School of Arts so on. Yet, none of them prepared me for the real world out there, for the realities of the contemporary art market and art business, how to face them, how to start, how to succeed. Yet, I didn’t want to give up on my students, I wanted to help, I wanted to share my knowledge and practice, something which I believe is every teacher’s true calling.” </p>
							<p>After teaching as a professor in University, Christina began to lecture independent from any institution. Have a large following of students world-wide, whose lives were transformed and even started her virtual internet-based courses, programs and lectures. To which we have a pleasure of inviting you!</p>
